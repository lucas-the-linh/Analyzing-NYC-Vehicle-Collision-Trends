# Project Analysis using (Python, JupyterNotebook)

**This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing New York City vehicle collision data to uncover patterns, identify risk factors, and enhance the reader's understanding of traffic safety dynamics within the city..**

Part 1: Data Overview & Exploratory Visualizations

- Examine the distribution of key variables such as crash time, location, and contributing factors.

Part 2: Explore Data Distribution

- Examine how data (numerical / categorical) distributed

Part 3: Incident Analysis & Spatial Visualizations

- Identify high-frequency crash zones and analyze relationships between vehicle types, street conditions, and collision severity.
